*This is an alternative implementation of KMeans clustering method in R. Even though there are many implementations of this algorithm on internet and in most of programming languages (R has its own as well), I decided to develop my onw to get a strong understading of this algorithm. For a better understanding of k-means method,check this following lecture here: http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/handouts/kmeans.html p.s: This is a general implementation of Kmeans
