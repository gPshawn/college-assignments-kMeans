#    This is an alternative implementation of KMeans clustering method in R. Even though there are many 
# implementations of this algorithm on internet and in most of programming languages (R has its own as well), 
# I decided to develop my onw using the classical Iris data set in order to get a strong understading of 
# this algorithm. For a betterunderstanding of the Naive Bayes Classifier, check this following lecture here: 
# http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/handouts/kmeans.html
# p.s: This is a general implementation of Kmeans
